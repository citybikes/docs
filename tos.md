# Terms of Service

CityBikes is a free service.

There's just one restriction: if your project is using this API you should indicate it on your app and website, linking the project page. If your project is using PyBikes you should also mention it. There's no need to put a huge 1k px banner on your website, just make a clear and noticeable statement about the source of the information that your project is using. Inform your users about it, let them find this data.

This restriction is meant to protect the work we do. We want to spread the word on the things we believe, this is not exactly open data as we adquire this information using many tricks. This is how the reality would look like if everything was open, but the world is not open yet. Not linking us means this message getting lost on its way.

We plan on adding a section about the projects using CityBikes. If you are interested, feel free to send us a line at info@citybik.es.

Happy Hacking!
